#Math Courses' Solutions
Proofs for assignments from online math courses I've found while self-studying math from a rigorous PoV.
Will continue updating the list of courses and books as I branch out to other topics.

##Acknowledgments
Thanks to the following professors that uploaded their courses online, which in turn help other people like me who want to self-study these topics. :)
