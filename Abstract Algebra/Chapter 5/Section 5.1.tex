\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	\textbf{Exercise 5.1.1.} Show that the center of a direct product is the direct product of the centers:
	$$Z(G_1 \times G_2 \times \cdots G_n) = Z(G_1) \times Z(G_2) \times \cdots Z(G_n)$$
	Deduce that a direct product of groups is abelian is abelian iff each of the factors is abelian. \\ \\
	\textbf{Proof:} It follows trivially from the fact that $gh = hg$ iff $g_ih_i = h_ig_i$ for each i where $g, h \in G = G_1 \times G_2 \times \cdots G_n$. \\
	The second part of the proof also follows trivially from the fact that $G = Z(G)$ iff $G$ is abelian. \\ \\
	\textbf{Exercise 5.1.5.} Exhibit a non-normal subgroup of $Q_8 \times Z_4$ (note that every subgroup of each factor is normal). \\ \\
	\textbf{Example:} Take $H = \langle(i, x)\rangle$, we have $(j, x)(i, x)(-j, x^3) = (-i, x) \not \in H$.
